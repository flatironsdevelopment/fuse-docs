## Overview
Status Webhooks are sent to your server when a new import has been processed and is available for consumption through the Fuse API.

To add a Status Webhook, go to the [Developers tab](https://fuse.flatirons.com/account/developers) of your Fuse account.

## Request Format

Fuse sends Status Webhook to your servers when a new import is available

Here is the request format:

```
{
  import_slug: '123-123-123-123',
  status: 'completed'
}
```

## Security
See [Webhook Security](https://fuse-docs.flatirons.com/accessing-data/webhook-security) to verify status webhook requests.

## Getting Import Data

You can [use the API](https://fuse-docs.flatirons.com/apis/resources/records/import-records) to get the data for the new import.
