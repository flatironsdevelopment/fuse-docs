To get up and running with Fuse, you should:

1. [Create an Importer](/getting-started/creating-an-importer) with columns, validations, and transformations.
2. [Embed your importer](/getting-started/embedding) or invite team members to use the Importer directly through Fuse.
3. [Access imported data](/accessing-data/overview) via the API or webhook.
