An Importer is one to one with a data schema supported by your system. You can [create an Importer](https://fuse.flatirons.com/account/importers) from within your Fuse account.  

A fully featured importer will have [columns](/getting-started/adding-columns), [validations](/getting-started/adding-data-validations/), and [transformations](/getting-started/adding-data-transformations/). You can add these through your Fuse account, or via code.

Importers can be launched directly from within your Fuse account, or they can be [embedded into your website](/getting-started/embedding/).
