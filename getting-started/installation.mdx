You can install the importer using Yarn, NPM, or a CDN. Note that the benefit of the CDN is that you can automatically get updates as we release new versions of the importer.

    If you are installing Fuse Importer in a React-based project, do:

    ```bash
    yarn add fuse-importer
    ```

    If your project does not have

    ```bash

    If you are installing Fuse Importer in a React-based project, do:

    ```bash
    npm install fuse-importer --save

    If you are installing Fuse Importer in a Vue or Angular-based project, do:

    If you're not using a module bundler or package manager, Fuse is also hosted on the [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/) CDN.

    Make sure to place the script tag before you initialize the importer.

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/fuse-importer@latest"></script>
    ```
